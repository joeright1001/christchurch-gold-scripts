# Place-Order Scripts Reorganization Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
The place-order folder has been reorganized from monolithic .txt files into a clean, modular structure matching the buy-gold reference pattern.

## üìÅ New Structure

### Head Section (`place-order/head/`)
Components that load early in the page `<head>`:
- **countdown-timer.js** - 30-minute countdown timer with cross-tab sync
- **date-picker-styles.css** - Flatpickr styling and date input CSS
- **form-error-styles.css** - Error states, spinner animations, button processing styles
- **main.js** - Combined and minified head scripts
- **main.css** - Combined and minified head styles

### Body Section (`place-order/body/`)
Components that require DOM to be loaded:
- **url-data-receiver.js** - URL parameter handling and form population
- **order-submission.js** - Main API submission logic and validation
- **form-field-updater.js** - Hidden field updates and delivery logic
- **time-picker-dropdown.js** - 12/24-hour time picker with business hours
- **nz-post-dropdown.js** - Comprehensive NZ Post location dropdown
- **date-picker-init.js** - Flatpickr initialization with business day rules
- **order-details-modal.js** - Modal close handlers and smooth scrolling
- **product-validation.js** - Product selection validation and error display
- **main.js** - Combined and minified body scripts (16.5KB, 51.7% size reduction)

## üîÑ Build System
- **Automated builds**: Run `.\build.ps1` in either head/ or body/ directories
- **Minification**: Uses terser for JS and clean-css for CSS optimization
- **Version control**: Auto-tags and deploys to GitHub with CDN URLs
- **Cross-referenced**: Both sections use the same centralized build-core.ps1

## üì¶ Generated Outputs
- **Head main.js**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joeright1001/christchurch-gold-scripts@v1.0.20/place-order/head/main.js`
- **Head main.css**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joeright1001/christchurch-gold-scripts@v1.0.20/place-order/head/main.css`
- **Body main.js**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joeright1001/christchurch-gold-scripts@v1.0.21/place-order/body/main.js`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Functionality Preservation
**ALL ORIGINAL FUNCTIONALITY MAINTAINED**:
- ‚úÖ URL parameter processing and form population
- ‚úÖ API submission to middleware with environment detection
- ‚úÖ Form validation (required fields, supplier checkbox, product selection)
- ‚úÖ Delivery/collection logic and total amount calculations
- ‚úÖ Date picker with business day restrictions

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved
1. **Modular Organization** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainable Code** - Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Optimized Performance** - 51.7% size reduction through minification
4. **Consistent Structure** - Matches buy-gold folder organization pattern
5. **CDN Ready** - Automatically deployed with version control
6. **No Functionality Loss** - Every feature from original .txt files preserved

## üìù Original Files Preserved
All original .txt files remain in place for reference:
- body.txt, code-*.txt files contain the original implementations
- New .js/.css files are organized extractions of this functionality
- Build system ignores .txt files, only processes .js/.css for bundling
